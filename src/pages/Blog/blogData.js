🥭 Why Choose Vanveda’s Gir Kesar Mango?

  • Direct from Our Farms in Gir: Grown in the fertile, red-soil belt near Gir National Park, our mangoes soak in the unique climate, giving them their famous saffron-like color and naturally sweet taste.

  • Authentic GI-Tagged Fruit: Gir Kesar Mango is the first agricultural product in India to get the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. This guarantees that our mangoes are authentic and grown only in Gir, Gujarat.

  • Certified Quality (GOPCA & FSSAI Approved): We follow strict post-harvest practices approved by Gujarat State Organic Products Certification Agency (GOPCA) and FSSAI standards, ensuring your mangoes are safe, clean, and premium-grade.

  • Naturally Ripened: No carbide, no chemicals – only traditional ripening with grass hay, so you enjoy the real sweetness of Kesar.

  • Handpicked & Packed with Care: Each box of 12 mangoes is hand-sorted, graded, and packed in a protective box to preserve freshness during 2-day express delivery.
